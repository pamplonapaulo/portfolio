    <h2>Making a long story short...</h2>
    
    <p>My story is a story of languages. After feeling like an expert in how to tell public audiences to do what my clients wanted, now my goal is to be an expert in computer languages: how to tell computers to do what my clients want. And I'm starting from the front portion of the codes.</p>
    <p>Back to the end of the 1990's, during my Journalism BA., I was in love with the deep Portuguese. I used to spend time alone reading those big old dictionaries, super curious about the ethimologic root of each word.</p>
    
    <p>During my Public Relations career, back to the 2000's, I had an amazing hobby: to learn the acting language, theatre, in one of the best schools in SÃ£o Paulo. Then after visiting Machu Picchu (Peru) in 2013, I got hit by the traveling virus and I decided to, first of all, get a good level of English. So in 2014 I moved to live 9 months in San Diego, California, where I attended a public school in the morning and a paid school at the afternoon, like an English overdose, incresed by an American girlfriend from Indiana. I need to get deep to learn the way I like.</p>
    
    <p>I came back to San Diego in 2016, this time spending 15 months, which's 12 dedicated to learn Front-End Web Development. I got really excited when I felt able to learn how to code, which I started to desire during my digital marketing experience, at the final years of my PR career.</p>
    
    <div class="parallax" style="background-image:url('../assets/LastClass-Formal.jpeg')"></div>

    <p>Between 2011 and 2013 I was still a "PR guy" but getting motivated from my bosses to become their "digital guy", since they saw how much I love technology. But while I was trying to get into the digital marketing career, I actually felt that digital marketing is not totally about technology, it is mostly advertising and PR stuff. I wanted to build the apps.</p>
    
    <p>In my childhood, my father shared a 64k bit computer with me, and I started to read the programs in Basic language, typing it to see how it works. During many many years I used to say that I was going to be a System Analist. However, somehow life changed and this dream got forgotten and my college was in a Social Communication/ Journalism degree.</p>
    
    <p>I had a lot of different experiences in my life, and now I look to the programming career also as a way to keep my brain very active. I'm the kind of person that will be studying something all my life. This is like a health insurance for me. This is like working out at a gym. I'm pretty humble, but confident and shameless enough to tell you that I'm a very high performance human being.</p>
    
    <p>I know how big is the challenge of changing my career and facing teenager competitors who know much more code than me. But this is a moment in my life that, after feeling unmotivated at the PR world, where I used to feel like a master, now I see that this challenge makes me feel really alive again. Motivation is everything to me.</p>
    
    <p>I could spend all day telling you more about me. But I think you already got a lot of information. So let's have a look at some pictures of my life. Oh, you may notice here that cooking is also another passion, and meditation as well. The intention here is actually to show you a skill in creating an API (Application Programming Interface) with AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) that can update this page with my Instagram posts in real time.</p>
   
    <p>So have fun stalking a little of me but don't loose your focus, don't forget to check the Portifolio and Know-how pages, which is pretty important!</p>
