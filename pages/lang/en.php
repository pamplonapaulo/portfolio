//ABOUT

$about_hero="The story of Paulo Pamplona";

$about_h2_1="It's a story of languages.";

$about_p1="I'm a former public relations now in a new career as a web developer. But I like to think that I'm a lover of languages. After 10 years dealing with media language, now I plan to spend at least 10 other years dealing with machine languages.";

$about_p2="Programming languages are the final fronteir of my literacy. Why? Well, despite good skills in my mother tongue, to learn English made me feel much less illiterate, considering the huge amount of English content at the World Wide Web. So now learning programming languages makes me feel like learning to read and write again. We live in a digital society and soon we might have more people writting apps than books. I'm seriouslly committed to become one of them.";

$about_h2_2="Technology background";

$about_p3="When I was a little kid, I saw basic language and spent some time writting it's code in a super old <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prológica_CP-400' target='_blank'>8-bit computer</a>. But it was studying <a href='http://pec.fgv.br/cursos/planejamento-de-midias-digitais' target='_blank'>digital marketing</a> in 2012 that I started to feel very frustrated by not being none of the ones under the coding part. I was not happy at the PR field anymore.";

$about_p4="This feeling was replaced by a huge excitement when I felt able to start a new life by learning how to code. I was taking short term classes with prof. Toni Renier and she encouraged me to apply to the Front-End certification program. Thank you, Toni. More details about this course at the <a href='front-end.php'>Front-End</a> page. For now, check here the happiness of me and my classmates at our final class on this program:";

$about_h2_3="Personal life";

$about_p5="In case you want to have a small taste of my personality, right bellow this page is connected to my Instagram account using an Application Programming Interface (API) with Asynchronous Javascript and XML (AJAX). Showing you this API skill is actually the real reason why my personal social media is here. So enjoy your chance to stalck me!";

//FRONT-END

$frontend_hero="My front-end skills";

$frontend_h2="Certification in California";

$frontend_p1="First of all I want to thank my professor <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/emikay/' target='_blank'>Emily Kay</a> and the San Diego Continuing Education school. I wouldn't be able to face a new career without this help. Emily tought me how to make my path in this field using my own legs.";

$frontend_p2="That said, I would like to invite you to check <a href='http://www.sdce.edu/job-training/computers/front-end-web-developer' target='_blank'>the scope of this certification program</a>, which took me two semesters of 360 hours each one. And here bellow you can have a quick overview of the knowledge that I'm getting so far:";

$frontend_p3="And just for the records, a proud student is suppose to show up the certificates itself. Right? So here they are:";

$frontend_p4="That's it. In case you have any extra question about my front-end skills, please <a href='contact.php'>contact me</a>. I'll be excited to know what exactly are you looking for.";
